# UnstableDiffusion

## Abstract
The main purpose of this project is to evaluate the impact of using synthetic images in the training set of text-to-image generative models. We employ multiple generations of training models, each of which uses synthetic images generated by the previous generation of models as training data. With this approach, we will get an overview of the potential impact of synthetic images on generative models
